The 1841 adds that she was living in the same household as her daughter Mary and her husband Henry Longman to whom George had left his business.  The Tithe Map also shows field names &#34Quarry Plot&#34 (1076) and &#34Quarry Field&#34 (1070) next to and near the farmhouse. As Ann was still the owner of &#34Quarry Plot&#34 it is a reasonable assumption that this was the site of George&#39s stone quarry which would have yielded upper lias limestone (aka Yeovil Stone).   &#34Quarry Field&#34 may have represented an earlier location of the workings.  George Maidment styles himself &#34brickmaker&#34 on his will of 1820 and it is likely that his brick works were those across Mudford Road (parcel 1066 on the Tithe Map)."

      "history": "The 1842 Yeovil Tithe Map shows a field (numbered 1427) labelled &#34Brickyard etc&#34 off Preston Lane (now Preston Road) next to the Union House (now Summerlands Hospital).  The land was owned by a John Moody and occupied by a William Baker.  A contemporary trade directory lists William Baker as a &#34Brickmaker and Lime Burner&#34 and the Tithe Map has a symbol (small circle within a square) next to the road which looks just like the symbol for a limekiln used on early OS maps.  William Baker was also the licnesee of one of Yeovil&#39s three King&#39s Arms. Two years earlier in 1840, there was a newspaper report of one Thomas Symes, a labourer from East Coker, prosecuted for stealing a shovel and a pick axe from &#34Mr Baker&#39s Quarry in Preston Lane, Yeovil&#34.  Now the BGS viewer places this site well within the Bridport Sands Formation and away from the nearest outcrop of Beacon limestone. This is consistent with the use of the clay in the lower beds of the Bridport Sands for brick making but possibly inconsistent with the use of the word &#34Quarry&#34 in the newspaper article.  It is possible that the limekiln was fed from other limestone quarries in the area.  The nearest documented ones are off Larkhill and on the Hollands Campus. Alternatively there may have been a hitherto undocumented quarry closer - on the 1887 OS map there are a number of suspicious ponds and what looks like disused rectangular workings north and west of the brickyard site.  The Tithe Map shows two fields to the north also owned by John Moody, called &#34Higher Marl Close&#34 (1440) and &#34Middle Marl Close&#34 (1440a) which almost suggests that this parcel may at one time have been called &#34Lower Marl Close&#34.  The site is empty on the 1887 OS Map but occupied by the houses of Westfield Road included on the 1904 and subsequent OS maps."

The BGS map shows this area as Bridport Sands but rubble from the field to the immediate North looks to be of Inferior Oolite age. Alternatively, the drop between the road and the south west field edge could be the back wall of a small quarry incompletely back filled. If so, this would indicate that the quarry was disused long before the house recorded on the Tithe Map was built.  There is plenty of stone (of Inferior Oolite age?) used in the boundary walls of &#34Catkins&#34 bungalow and the back face (?) of the &#34quarry&#34 has a rubblestone retaining wall. Also this would mean that this is a hitherto unmapped outlier of Inferior Oolite but continuing the pattern of outcrops along Chiselborough Hill."

The Buckman&#39s owned the farm and there were two quarries operating on his land, this being one, used as a source of roadstone and rough building stone. The other claim to fame of James Buckman (he had been professor of botany and geology at the Royal College of Agriculture in Cirencester) is that he was the father  of the modern parsnip  because of his plant breediung eperiments."

In 2011 planning approval was granted to Purbeck Lovell Ltd for extension eastwards of the workings and erection of buildings and the Mapbox satellite image shows these. In 2014 further planning approval was granted to the operator (now called Lovell Stone Group) for another extension.  In 2017 nearing the end of the accessible reserves south of the road, a planning application was approved to extend the quarry to the north side of the road to work the reseves there (mainly Blue Lias). In 2020 further planning approval was granted to extend the northern extension towards the east.  The BGS map shows this site on the boundary between the blue lias and white lias formations and the detailed geological assessments included with the planning applications confirm that both stones occur and are quarried at this site. They also indicate that the reason for the rather fragmented small scale historic pit workings is the faulted geology of the site."

By 2006 the building had disappeared and both sites are marked by copses.

However, new workings labelled &#34Quarry&#34 have appeared in the field opposite the limekilns in Long Sutton parish on the north side of the road.  The Long Sutton workings and the limekilns disappear from the later OS editions.  There are faint traces of the older smaller round pits visible on the 1946 aerial photograph and even fainter traces on the 2006 one. There are some suggestive crop marks on the Mapbox satellite image.  In 2012 the Long Sutton field was subject to a geophysical survey which showed disturbance of medieval features by the quarrying activities. "

The 1886, 1903 and 1930 OS maps show a rectangular pond or enclosure which may be the remnant of a pit. It  is covered by trees but clearly visible on the 1946 and 2006 aerial photographs.   There is a similar pond just to the east which is associated with the Batt&#39s Lane quarry site. The geology of the site is consistent with Blue Lias quarrying. "

In 2018 a planning application was made to restart quarrying operations to the immediate west of the historic workings.

The 1886 OS map shows small roughly rectangular workings to the west of these fields, a double &#34L.K.&#34 next to the road and the &#34Limekiln Inn (B.H.)&#34 behinds the kilns.

The 1930 edition does not show the depression, it is clearly visible on the 1946 aerial photograph and ploughed out on the 2006 aerial photograph.  However, the Mapbox satellite image has crop marks which reveal the extent of the shallow workings in the vicinity.  In particular the area next to the Kingsdon road opposite the Limekiln Inn seems to have been particulary exploited which is consistent with the sitings of the kilns but suggests that the peak of operations was before the first edition OS map (1886) and possibly before the Tithe Map (1844).  By looking at the occupations of the residents of the Limekiln Inn (which was first licensed in 1814) as recorded by the census, some insight can be had into the history of quarrying and limeburning at this location: in 1841, John Dyer was described as a &#34lime burner&#34; in 1851 John Downton was a &#34innkeeper and farmer&#34; in 1861 Joseph Williams was a &#34licensed victualler and limeburner&#34; in 1871, Samuel Clarke was an &#34innkeeper and limeburner&#34; in 1881, John Culliford was an &#34innkeeper, limeburner and quarry proprietor&#34; in 1891 Alfred Palmer was an &#34innkeeper&#34.

The land immediately to the east of the site has been used for a avriety of purposes including flagstone manufacture, cider making, vaping oil storage and it is now (2022) occupied by business units.

The whole complex is labelled &#34Tout Quarries&#34. The 1904 edition shows &#34Tout Quarries&#34 enlarged in both the north and south quarries.  In 1911 there was an acrimonious court case against George Penny Hallett (quarry operator - George was the son of a widow, Jane Hallett, but acknowledged as the son of Robert Penny who he succeeded in the quarry business) and Sidney Male (landowner) in that they did &#34unlawfully and wilfully obstruct tbe passage of a certain footway through a field called South Field, by causing to be erected a certain shed, crane, and heaps of stone without just cause&#34.  They lost their case and were fined. However, it would appear to have been a case of &#34losing the battle, but winning the war&#34 because Tout Quarry expanded considerably in subsequent years and, by the time of the 1946 aerial photograph, was occupying a large proportion of the field north of Tout House (South Field?).  It also shows significant quarrying activity south of Tout Lane.  The 1959 OS map labels these latter workings as &#34Old Quarries&#34 but shows those north of Tout Lane as further enlarged and labelled &#34Quarries&#34.  From 1930 onwards, the quarry was owned and operated by S Morris Ltd  who also developed a ready mix concrete and pre-cast concrete products businesses in the 1950s. Succeeding S Morris as the quarry operator,  Richard England (the operator of a Ham Hill Quarry) successfully applied for planning permission to extract blue lias at Tout Quarry in 1993 and started operations in 1995.  One of the uses for the stone was the production of hydraulic lime on the quarry site.  Planning permission for the lime production expired in 2002 and after an abortive attempt to relocate production to Appledoor Quarry off the Ilchester to Langport road it finally moved to Lincolnshire.  Quarrying however continued and in 2019 further extensions to the quarrying operation were approved.  The site continues (2022) to be used by S Morris for their concrete businesses and by Tor Trucks who repair lorries and commercial vehicles.  Tout Quarry is now the headquarters and main workshop site for the Ham and Doulting Stone Company run by Richard England&#39s son, Zak.   "

There is no map evidence for such a quarry.  The original articles in the Journal of Roman Studies would probably answer any questions of location.  The HER entry does not help because it talks about &#34Windmill Hill&#34 which is well to the west of the grid reference.  Later reports (1929) identify this site with Clayton & Co Ltd.   In 1930, Claytons gave permission for parishoners to dump their rubbish in their quarry near the &#34Council Houses&#34. Presumably these were the new council houses in Peddles Lane, if not then there is a possibility that Clayton&#39s had two quarries in the Charltons.  1934 two skeletons were found by quarrymen working in &#34Clayton&#39s Quarry&#34 which were thought to be victims of the backlash after the Battle of Sedgemoor.  The report in the Langport and Somerton Herald describes the quarry as near the site of the original Charlton Mackrell Church and some demolished cottages and also as having been the source quarry for many of the Charlton buildings all of which may or may not be accurate."

In 1951, they successfully applied  for planning permission to extend the quarry to the north and the east.  The cement works were demolished in 1968 (when Barham Bros ceased their operations in Charlton Mackrell?).  The quarry site as well as the Barham Bros company name was sold to local businessman Brian Wellstead and his wife who lived at Somerleigh opposite the quarry in Station Road (see Station Quarry later).  There are a number of (brick and block) buildings on the south of the site which are probably survivals of the cement works days.  Ther is a deep gully running NE-SW across the site which is probably a remnant of the quarrying or the back-filling operations. A few doors away in Station Road there is a porperty called &#34Quarry Close&#34.  The property itself is a Woolaway bungalow built c1960 but the name may refer to a previous field name.  In 2002 the Wellsteads applied for planning permission to erect eight houses on tyeh site of the original quarry and cement works.  The application was rejected by South Somerset District Council.

He extended the operation in a north east direction as the stone reserves became exhausted.  First, in 1982,  permission was granted to reopen the nineteenth century quarry (see Combe Lane South), then in 1985 the next field off Combe Lane and finally in 1990 the site of the previous Charlton Mackrell station yard was given over to quarrying.   The latest OS mapping calls the north east corner of the site &#34Station Quarry (limestone)&#34 and marks the adjacent part of the site with &#34workings (dis)&#34. The disused quarry is clearly seen on later imagery. The site includes a deep water filled working and is used (2022) as a dump for building refuse and in 2019 for recreational purposes, as a 4x4 offroad driving circuit and a paintball range.  Spons Quarry Guide (2006 edition) lists &#34Peddles Lane Quarry&#34 as owned by the J D Pearce Quarry Company and managed by J D Pearce of Johnstone House, Church Steet, Keinton Mandeville."

The case was a complicated one but did involve restoration of the quarried land back to agricultural use.  Mr King continued to quarry in this area and described his workings as &#34abuting the Kingsweston road&#34. The 1946 aerial photograph shows some activity in the form of a long thin crescent shaped excavation towards the southern end of Sandpits Land also visible on later images.  The 2019 lidar shows a sub-rectangular depression about 300 yards east.  A 1933 report of complaints to the Parish Council mentions Bird Bros quarry adjoing the road near Sandpits.  It is possible that Mr King had sold his interest in the quarry to Bird Bros, a building firm from Yeovil who also had a sideline in charabanc tours. In 1939 Bird Bros of Woodlands Yeovil offered a &#34disused quarry&#34 for sale on Charlton Adam - this coud be a different site or the original identification od Bird Bros with this site was wrong."

However, some of the spoil heaps are visible on the ground in 2021. The White Lias limestone quarried here were used for &#34building lime and wall stone&#34 and possibly for road construction. In 1856 the quarrying and limeburning business passed from quarryman and limeburner John Samson (1798-1867) to farmer Henry Dauncey (1816-1858), both of Sparkford. By 1869 the business was in the hands of Jonas Watts (1831-1896) of Sparkford.  In 1881 Jonas was recorded as simply &#34farmer&#34.

There are no local church monuments carved in local alabaster (yet to be confirmed) but there are records of &#34plaster pits&#34 elsewhere in the locality.  Also in Collinson&#39s time gypsum was sometimes used as a soil improver.  Subsequent directories merely repeat Collinson&#39s phrase.  The field below the site is called &#34Plaster Hill&#34 on the SOmerton Tithe Map. The first edition (1888) OS map shows extensive workings labelled &#34Quarry&#34 in the hill behind Hurcot Farm. The 1903 OS map still shows the workings but the label has changed to &#34Old Quarry&#34 indicating that it had been abandoned by this time.  Two boreholes were drilled for water in 1936 and they reveal the extent of the alabaster (more probably gypsum) deposits in the area, in excess of 50ft over two major seams. The workings are possibly visible on the 1946 RAF aerial photograph.  According to a note added to the BGS borehole report there were &#34new&#34 quarry workings in 1948 and so the quarry had reopened and was in use in 1951 when it exhibited at the Glastonbury&#39s Festival Week (not the modern one but a local version of the Festival of Britain!). Operations ceased in 1953, there were moves to reopen the gypsum mine in 1975 but by the time of the 2006 SCC aerial photograph the site was overgrown with trees and bushes.  The modern OS map shows the remains of workings labelled &#34Quarry (dis)&#34 with a much larger footprint than previous maps corresponding to the post WWII extraction."

Local residents, the Ramblers Association, the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England eventually got their way, no quarrying or limeburning went ahead and Hydraulic Lias Lime moved their operation to Lincolnshire.  One press report at the time suggested that the quarry had last been worked in the early 1970s.   In recent years (2019) Appledoor Quarry has been used to stage Motocross events."

This might be a clue as might the linear outcrops either side of the road marked on the 1886 and 1904 maps and still discernible in part today (2022).  As far as the eponymous Mr Watts is concerned, it is most likely that this is Samuel Watts of nearby Kingsdon.  Starting in 1841 consecutive census records show his occupation as &#34mason&#34, &#34master mason&#34, &#34proprietor stone quarry&#34, &#34quarry master&#34 and &#34retired&#34.  It is possible that he worked Highbrooks and sold it before 1881 when the quarry changed its name but the lane did not.  In 1886, there was an active quarry within a few hundred yards of where Samuel Watts lived in Kingsdon which almost certainly was worked by him and his employees."

The 1886 OS map shows two sets of workings, a medium sized sub-rectangular one in the corner between Mill Lane and CAtsgore Road labelled &#34Ashencross Quarry&#34 completed with a building and a single kiln labelled &#34L.K.&#34 and a second on the west side of Catsgore road about 150 yards south of the main workings.  There is also an indication of a third, very small, set to the north of Ashen Cross itself.  The the 1904 edition the main workings have changed shape and still labelled &#34Ashencross Quarry&#34, the lesser one slightly enlarged and the kiln is labelled &#34Old Limekiln&#34.  The 1931 edition still shows the &#34Old Limekiln&#34, the main workings much enlarged and labelled &#34Ashencross Quarry&#34 and the southern workings also much enlarged and now labelled &#34Quarry&#34.  The 1946 aerial photograph shows the two sets of workings enlarged and merged, albeit straddling Catsgore Road.  The 1962 OS map shows the &#34Old Limekiln&#34, &#34Ashencross Quarry&#34 and the &#34Old Quarry&#34 stretching between Catsgore Road and Highbrooks Road.  In 1998 planning permission was granted to AR Purnell to extract blue lias limestone from the site, thus reopening and enlarging the previous quarry.  The 2006 aerial photograph show an active site with the original workings to the east of Catsgore Road backfilled and those to the west having migrated northwards to the point where they now fill the area bounded by Catsgore Road, Mill Lane and Highbrooks Road.   The site of the historic Ashencross Quarry is now partly occupied by allotment gardens.  In 2021 planning permission was granted for the further extension of the quarry, this time stretching the workings southwards along the west side of Catsgore Raod.  "

Whether the limekiln on the Tithe Map was using stone from the site on the OS map, whether it was part of the plastering business or even if the quarry was opened in before 1843 is not clear.  The field that became the quarry site was owned and occupied in 1843 by one Arthur Mead listed in the 1851 Census as a mason.  Perhaps Arthur ran the quarry, kept the decent stone for his masonry business and carted the offcuts and samller bits off to John for burning.  By 1904 the OS map drops the label but still shows a small quarry face.  By 1931 the quarry face has been partially built on.  The site is now occupied by the houses west of Bancombe House.  "

In 1841 there were four William Eades living in Butleigh: one (b1783) was a yeoman farmer; another (b1790) was a stone cutter (ie a quarry man) - possibly the son of the leasee of the Westfield quarry; another (b1805) was a stone engraver; and the last (b1818) was also a stone cutter.

Both sets of abandoned workings are visible on the 1946 aerial photograph and there is rough scrubland on the 2006 photograph corresponding to the older northern set of workings.  There is a newspaper report from the Wells Journal in November 1894 that describes &#34Green Pit&#39s Quarry&#34 as an &#34old&#34 one belonging to R Neville Grenville.  It also mentions that he was opening a new roadstone quarry - possibly those at Rock&#39s Plantation but these were known as &#34Quarry Ground&#34 also owned by Rev George Neville Grenville at the time of the Tithe apportionment and appearing on the 1886 OS map which hardly suggests a &#34new quarry&#34.  In 1927 the tenant of Green Pits reported to the County Surveyor (of highways?) the absence of fencing around the quarries in the Parish - apparently the County Council operated four such roadstone quarries in Butleigh parish."

James junior was an agricultural labourer and is recorded in the 1841 Census and 1844 Tithe Map as living at Spring Gardens.  The identification of the eastern workings with the quarry in the orchard is confused by the fact that the quarry is on the opposite side of the road as the cottages and not &#34behind&#34 them as described in the for-sale notice."

The 2006 photograph shows the site back filled and ploughed over.  In 1903 Benjamin Wyatt, the farmer of Lower Farm, submitted a bill to William Dickinson, local landowner, to compensate his &#34Loss of land&#34 to a quarry - presumably the one on this site which is about 300 yards east of Lower Farm."

Both are indicated to be worked at the time by W Ridewood and E Squire respectively, indicating that they were separate quarries in contrast to the impression given by the OS map label.  The name &#34Ham Hill Quarry&#34 is itself interesting if not a little confusing.  There is no local feature called &#34Ham Hill&#34 and the site is on the flank of the low rise known as &#34Kings Hill&#34.

The whole complex is labelled &#34Coombe Hill Quarry&#34.  There are traces of earlier pits to the north, straying into West Lydford parish.  The 1904 OS map shows &#34Coombe Hill Quarry&#34 as having lost a crane and been slightly enlarged eastwards in the northern section of the quarry.  The 1931 OS map shows the workings unchanged but still labels it &#34Coombe Hill Quarry&#34.  The 1931 Cox map shows it as an old quarry belonging to G Sutton.  The 1946 aerial photograph shows the extent of the quarry.  The site is (2022) occupied by the properties &#34Little Coombe&#34 and &#34Coombe Quarry&#34 and hosts a caravan site.  The back wall of the quarry is marked by a deep gouge in the wooded grounds of &#34Coombe Quarry&#34."

      "history": "According to a former owner, Janet Pearce, this quarry started life in the 1950s when her husband dug out some stone slabs from their garden and a passing stranger bought them.  Following planning permissions in 1951 and 1954, it went on to become a successful quarry.  It does not appear on the 1:25000 OS maps of the 1950s and 1960s.  The Pearces sold the quarry to Nigel Cox who renewed and updated the planning permsission in 1998 and continued to extract the blue lias until at least 2009.  The 2006 SCC aerial photograph gives a good view of the extent of Lakeview Quarry.  After the quarry ceased production, Nigel Cox&#39s company, Lakeview Stone Supplies, unsuccessfully in 2007 and then, after much local debate and campaigning, successfully in 2016 applied for planning permission to develop the site for residential purposes.  Various exposures of the blue lias beds that are the reminders of the previous quarrying operations can be seen as you walk around the housing estate. "

      "history": "The 1886 OS map shows a complex set of workings on the east of Queen Street opposite the School with three &#34cranes&#34 and some buildings labelled &#34Quarry&#34 and some further water-filled workings to the south labelled &#34Quarry&#34.  The 1904 edition shows the northern &#34Quarry&#34 workings simplified and the crane count reduced to one and the southern workings unlabelled.  The 1931 edition does not show the northern workings but still shows the waterfilled ones to the south.  There are some workings, unusually small and square, shown behind Manor House Farm.  This site does not feature on the 1931 Cox map.  However there is Langport and Somerton Herald newspaper report from April 1932 about the suicide of Mr Bernard Brooks (the retired Keinton postmaster suffering from heart problems and depression), who drowned in the pond of the &#34School Quarry&#34.  The body was found by a Mr Squire from Barton St David who had come to Keinton to collect a load of walling stone from &#34his father&#39s quarry&#34.  A Mr E Squire does appear on the Cox map as the operator of &#34Chisels Quarry&#34 which is situated to the west of the School but, according to the OS map, did not have any waterfilled workings.  It is possible that the quarry site on the east of Queen Street was also owned by Mr Squire senior and by 1931 no longer used as a quarry but more as a stone yard.  This would explain why Mr Squire junior went to the site were there was a pond marked on the OS map.  The site is now (2022) occupied by the 1980s residential development called &#34Manor Park&#34."

In 1918 the quarry was reopened and by  1929 the OS map shows the workings have grown significantly and  labelled &#34Worth Quarries&#34. cA &#34Travelling Crane&#34 is included on the map. The 1949 edition shows little change. The quarry was extended southwards and was worked as a source of aggreagte by Tarmac until they sold it to the local quarrying and transport firn of Suttles in 2011. Today (2021) the quarry is extensive still producing aggregate from the Portland beds (freestone and chert)."

      "history": "The 1887, 1904, 1931 and 1947 OS maps all show extensive workings labelled &#34Quarries&#34 and buildings labelled &#34Yawl Limekilns&#34 north of &#34Limekiln Lane&#34.  The Mapbox satellite image shows the site of the quarries occupied by modern detached houses. The BGS viewer suggests that this quarry is near the boundary between the white and blue lias outcrops and so it is possible that both varieties of limestones were extracted from this site.  According to local newspaper reports there was a tragic and gruesome accident at the quarry in 1847.  Henry Fowler, a 31 year old lime burner, was working alone when he fell into the top of one of the limekilns.  The charred remains of his body were not found until the next day.  The report says that the limekiln was situated 30 yards from the home of Job Fowler, Henry&#39s employer, whom the 1841 Census records as living at &#34Yawl&#34.   Fowler was a common name in East Devon at the time with 66 occurrences in the 1841 census just in Uplyme.  It is likely that Job, who was about 60 at the time of the accident, was Henry Fowler&#39s father as well as his employer.  It is also possible that at least one of them was related to a George Fowler who had died in an accident at nearby Carswell Quarry in 1830. Tragedy once again struck the Yawl Limestone Quarries when in 1865 three were killed - two men George Huxford and Eli Cox and a boy Charles Gosling.  George Huxford was 48 and left a widow and two children. Eli Cox was 28 and about to get married.  Charles Gosling was only 16. They were killed  by a massive collapse of 100 tons of limestone and it took a working party of villagers several hours to recover the bodies.  At this tme of the accident, the quarry was owned by the Rev Charles Ethelstone, rector of Uplyme, and operated by Simeon Fowler, son of Job Fowler, who was listed  in the 1861 census as a farmer and lime merchant living at Yawl Lime Kilns and employing 24 men and 3 boys.  It is reported that the men had ignored Mr Fowler&#39s warning to avoid the dangerously undermined part of the quarry.  The report in the Dorset County Chronicle seemed to focus as much on the geology of the accident as on the human tragedy, giving such details as the upper beds were white and blue lias and usually removed first before the lower beds were worked for lime burning. At the inquest Simeon Fowler confirmed that his father and grandfather had operated the quarries producing &#34lime-stone and building stone for more than 50 years&#34. He further confirmed that there had been two men killed in 1829 and another in about 1853 in a similar manner to the 1865 accident.  In 1894 and 1895, a G H Fowler of the Lime Works, Uplyme, was advertising for workers in the local press.  Presumably this was George Fowler, third son of Simeon, and possibly the fourth generation of Fowlers to operate the quarries and kilns at Uplyme."

Modern extraction has been from at least the 1970s with a period of inactivity around 2008 and in 2021 a planning application was approved to extend the workings further in a north westerly direction.  The quarry exposes the Upper Greensand, Beer Head limestone beds as well as the chalk and naturally has attracted the attention of the geologists and is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest."

The size and shape of the putative &#34Quarry Close&#34 and the location of the quarry within the enclosure would determine which rock type was extracted from the quarry.  Based purely on the speculation that a pre-enclosure quarry would be more likely to be used for building and walling material than for lime burning, the fact there was a nearby sandstone quarry (near Broad Knoll) and the closeness of the medieval church and village of Winscombe suggests that it was a sandstone quarry.  More reserach and field work would be required to establish the precise location and nature of the quarried stone.  "

Operations has continued to the present day (2021) albeit with changes of ownership and technology.  Limeburning ceased in 1969 as the reserves of Burrington Oolite decreased and the quarrying shifted to producing aggregate and concrete products from the lower grade limestone (Black Rock?).

In 1870 the Polyphant quarry was described as being &#34recently re-opened&#34 and the property of Mr W Day-Hanson of nearby Bowden Derras. The 1884 OS map shows &#34Polyphant Quarry&#34 with active workings at the south end of the site together with a &#34crane&#34 and inactive workings on the north.  The 1907 edition retains the label and shows a &#34tramway&#34 leading south.  The 1950 and 1965 editions label the site &#34Polyphant Quarry&#34.

The brewery was styled the &#34Stogumber Medicinal Spring Brewery&#34 and took its water from &#34Harry Hill&#39s Well&#34 in the corner of a nearby field.  There is an improbable story that Harry Hill was a medieval leper miraculously cured by the spring waters but this does sound like a bit of Victorian fake news circulated to promote the Stogumber Pale Ale &#34brewed expressly for the Clergy, and others of weak lungs&#34.  Mr Elers continued at least until 1851 and by 1881 the brewery was run by Capt John Sloman.  At some time during this period quarrying and lime burning had returned to the site for an &#34Old Quarry&#34 and &#34Old Limekiln&#34 are recorded on the first two editons of the OS map.  The kiln and quarry face are still marked on the modern OS map and the outline of the quarry traceable as the edge of a wood on the aerial and satellite photographs.  The local geology would have influenced the quality of both the spring water used for brewing and the rocks used for lime burning.  The BGS viewer shows Harry Hill&#39s Well on the Devonian outcrop and the quarry on the Wiveliscombe Sandstone outcrop.  The BGS memoir explains that this sandstone is calcareous enough to be burnt for lime but also suitable for building and further suggests that the brewery itself was built using stone from the quarry - this would explain the occurence and demise before the 1887 OS map.
